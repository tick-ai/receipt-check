"""Check a Tick document offline, without Tick's code: written from spec/SPEC.md alone.

verify_document(text) reads one document, picks its check by the document's own
"schema", and answers a Verdict: whether the document is the one that was
written, every reason it is not, and what the document says it does not
establish. It makes no network call and asks no one. Like the specification's
own verifier it cannot tell whether what a document says is true.
